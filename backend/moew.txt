### 🗳️ Online Voting System using MERN-Stack + Imgur + SendGrid + Twilio 🌐

This is a hobby project focused on improving my overall web development skills, particularly backend development. The web design is secondary, as the project emphasizes backend functionality.

#### What's special about this project:

1. ✉️ **SendGrid**: Used to send emails directly via JavaScript.

2. 📲 **Twilio**: Allows sending messages directly from JavaScript.

3. 🖼️ **Imgur API**: Used to upload party logos.

4. 🔐 **Two-Factor Authentication**: Secured via email.

**Note**: After clicking any button, please wait a moment — it’s likely loading ⏳.

### ⚙️ Key Features:

- 👨‍💻 **Admin Console**: The admin can manage voting phases (registration, voting, results) and reset the entire database for a fresh start. Only the admin has the ability to create new political parties.

- 🗂️ **Voter & Candidate Registration**: Users sign up during the registration phase. Only registered voters can participate in the voting process.

- 📊 **Live Poll Results**: The homepage displays live polling results in descending order.
